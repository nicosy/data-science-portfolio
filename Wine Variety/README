Wine classifier challenge

Learning Objective: Execute data analysis workflow end-to-end

Project Objective: How well can I use the available data (chemical analysis) to classify the origin of specific wines?

Data: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine

Built with R and R Studio

Running Order:
script_variety_1_only
script_variety_2_only
script_variety_3_only
script_multivariate_prediction

Acknowledgements: Bryn Humphreys' write up on Kaggle helped me get started (https://www.kaggle.com/brynja/testing-classifiers-for-wine-variety-prediction). Reproduced his initial goal of singling out one wine variety from the other two. I then added a multivariate test to identify all 3 varieties of wine simultaneously.
